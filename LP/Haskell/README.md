## Programming Languages
### ▪️ What will you find?
You can find all my practice exercices using Haskell functional programming, a project in Python.
### ▪️ Haskell
You can use ghc for the haskell exercices (*.hs). You should use the compiler (ghc) for programms which have main and the interpreter (ghci) for prgrams that doesn't have a main (most of them).
